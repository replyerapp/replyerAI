## Terms of Use for Replyer

Last updated: December 2025  

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the **Replyer** mobile application (the "App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 1. Description of the Service

Replyer is an AI‑assisted tool that helps you:
- Generate suggested replies to messages based on screenshots and context you provide.
- Analyze conversations (e.g., "Decode Message" / dating coach insights).
- Use multiple screenshots to provide more context ("Full Story" mode).
- Save contact profiles with notes and preferred tones.
- Optionally train the AI to mimic your writing style ("My Style").

The App uses third‑party AI services (such as Google Gemini API) to generate suggestions. All outputs are **suggestions only** and should be reviewed by you before sending.

You must:
- Be at least the minimum age required by local law to use such services (typically 13 or 16).
- Have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.

By using the App, you represent that you meet these requirements.

- Illegal or abusive content.

### 4.2 AI‑Generated Suggestions

We are **not responsible** for messages you choose to send to others based on suggestions from the App.

Your use of the App is also governed by our **Privacy Policy**, which explains:

## 6. Subscriptions, Purchases, and Billing

### 6.1 Pro Subscription

Replyer offers optional **Pro** features (e.g., Full Story mode, My Style, Decode Message, Contact Profiles, higher limits).  
Access to these features is granted through in‑app purchases and subscriptions managed by Apple and RevenueCat.

### 6.2 Billing

- Purchases and subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID via the App Store.
- Prices, billing cycles, and free‑trial terms are displayed in the App and in the App Store at the time of purchase.

We do not receive your full payment card information; all payments are processed by Apple.

- Subscriptions may automatically renew at the end of each billing period, as indicated by Apple.
- You can cancel or manage your subscription at any time via your **Apple ID account settings** or `https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions`.
- If you cancel, your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period; you will not receive a refund for the remaining time, unless required by law or Apple’s policies.

## 7. Fair Use and Limits

To maintain service quality and protect our infrastructure, we may:
- Apply reasonable usage limits (e.g., daily free generations, rate‑limits for API calls).
- Restrict access if your usage appears abusive, automated, or inconsistent with personal use.

We may change free usage limits or Pro feature scopes in future updates.

## 8. Third‑Party Services and Links

The App integrates third‑party services (e.g., Google Gemini API, RevenueCat) and may display links (e.g., to privacy policy, terms, subscription management).

We are not responsible for:
- The availability, accuracy, or content of third‑party services or websites.
- Any damage or loss arising from your use of those third‑party services.

Your use of third‑party services is governed by their own terms and policies.

We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if:
- You materially breach these Terms.
- We are required to do so by law, a regulator, or a platform provider.
