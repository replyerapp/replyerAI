# App Store Screenshots (6 pack)

This repo includes a **DEBUG-only** tool that generates **6 App Store-ready screenshots** and saves them to Photos.

## How to generate

1. Run the app on a real device or simulator from Xcode (Debug).
2. Open **Settings** (gear icon).
3. Scroll to **Debug → App Store Screenshots**.
4. Tap **Export 6 Screenshots to Photos**.
5. Open the Photos app → export the images to Files / Mac for upload to App Store Connect.

## Output size

The exporter renders at **iPhone 6.7"** resolution:

- **1290 × 2796 px** (rendered as **430 × 932 pt** at scale 3)

This is a common “large iPhone” screenshot size accepted by App Store Connect.
