## Privacy Policy for Replyer

Last updated: December 2025  

This Privacy Policy explains how **Replyer** ("Replyer", "we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Replyer mobile application (the "App").

Replyer is designed to help you generate smart, personalized replies to messages. We take your privacy seriously and collect as little data as possible to provide this functionality.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Conversation Screenshots and Photos
- When you use the App, you can choose to upload **screenshots or photos of your conversations** from your device's photo library.
- These images are used **only to generate replies or analyses (e.g., decode message, full story, style mimicry)**.
- The images are:
  - Accessed from your device **with your explicit permission**.
  - **Sent securely** to our AI service provider (Google Gemini API) for processing.
  - **Not stored by us on our servers**.

We do **not**:
- Store these conversation screenshots on our own servers.
- Publish or share your screenshots with other users.
- Use them for advertising.

> Note: As with any third‑party API, Google may log or process data as described in its own privacy policy. We do not control or manage Google’s internal retention policies.

### 1.2 Style Mimicry Samples ("My Style")
If you choose to use the **My Style / Style Mimicry** feature:
- You may upload 3–5 screenshots of **your own sent messages** to train the AI on your writing style.
- These screenshots are:
  - Sent once to the Google Gemini API to analyze your writing style.
  - Used to generate a **style profile** (a JSON description of your tone, emoji usage, punctuation, etc.).
  - **Not stored as images** by the App after analysis; only the extracted style profile and a small counter are saved.

We store **only**:
- A style profile (text description, no raw message content).
- The number of samples analyzed.
- Timestamps indicating when the profile was created/updated.

This data is stored **locally on your device** using `UserDefaults` and may be included in your device backups (e.g., iCloud) according to your OS settings. You can delete it at any time from the **My Style** screen.

### 1.3 Contact Profiles
If you use **Contact Profiles**:
- You can save:
  - Contact name.
  - Relationship label (e.g., Friend, Situationship).
  - Optional notes (e.g., "Hates emojis, loves sarcasm").
  - Optional preferred tone.
  - Optional emoji to visually represent the contact.
- This information is stored **locally on your device** and is used only to adapt AI responses for that contact.
- No contact profile information is sent to any third‑party except as part of the prompt text you send to the AI model (for example, the notes you write for the AI).

We do not upload contact profiles to our own servers.

### 1.4 Usage and Subscription Data
We use:
- **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions and purchases.

These services may collect:
- Anonymous or pseudonymous identifiers (e.g., app instance ID, RevenueCat ID).
- Purchase history and entitlement status (e.g., whether you are Pro or Free).
- Basic device information (e.g., platform, app version, language).

We do not receive your full payment card data; all payments are processed by Apple via the App Store.

### 1.5 Diagnostic Data
To improve stability and fix bugs, we may log:
- Error messages (e.g., API errors from Google Gemini or RevenueCat).
- Non‑personal technical information (e.g., which feature failed, generic error strings).

We do **not** log or store:
- The actual text of your messages.
- Your uploaded images or screenshots.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above solely to:

- Generate AI‑powered reply suggestions and analyses from your screenshots and context.
- Learn your preferred writing style (when you opt in).
- Apply your contact rules and tone preferences when generating replies.
- Manage your subscription entitlements and determine whether features should be unlocked (Pro vs. Free).
- Improve the App’s reliability, UI, and user experience.

We **do not**:
- Sell your personal data.
- Use your screenshots or chat content for advertising.
- Share your conversation data with third parties other than the AI provider(s) required to provide core functionality.

## 3. Third‑Party Services

Replyer integrates the following third‑party services:

1. **Google Gemini API (Google Generative AI)**  
   - Purpose: Generate replies, analyze conversations, learn your writing style, and decode message psychology.  
   - Data sent: Prompts containing your conversation text, context you provide, style profile JSON, and images/screenshots you upload.  
   - For more details, please review Google’s own privacy documentation.

2. **RevenueCat**  
   - Purpose: Manage in‑app purchases and subscriptions, determine Pro access.  
   - Data used: Purchase identifiers, subscription status, anonymous user identifiers, region, and platform metadata.

All communication with these services is performed over HTTPS.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- **Conversation screenshots used for generating replies or decoding messages** are:
  - Kept only in memory while processing and not stored in persistent storage by the App.
  - Transmitted to Google Gemini API for processing and then discarded by the App.
- **Style profiles and contact profiles** are stored locally on your device and remain until you delete the App or manually reset them within the App.
- **Subscription and analytics data** are stored by RevenueCat in accordance with their own retention policies.

If you uninstall the App, local data stored in `UserDefaults` is removed from your device.

---

## 5. Your Choices and Controls

- You can choose **not** to grant photo permissions. In that case, you will not be able to upload screenshots, and some features will not work.
- You can **delete your style profile** and clear any pending samples from the **My Style** screen.
- You can **edit or delete contact profiles** at any time from the **Contact Profiles** screen.
- You can disable analytics at the system level if Apple provides such controls (e.g., Limit Ad Tracking, privacy settings).

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Replyer is not intended for children under the age required by local law (typically 13 or 16). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.

---

## 7. Security

We use industry‑standard measures (HTTPS, platform security features) to protect data in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your device secure and updated.

---

## 8. International Transfers

Our third‑party providers (Google, RevenueCat) may process data on servers located in different countries. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to these providers as necessary to provide the service.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top. Continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the new Policy.

---

## 10. Rights for EU/EEA, UK and Other Regions

If you are located in the **European Economic Area (EEA)**, the **United Kingdom**, or a region with similar data protection laws (such as the GDPR), the following additional information applies:

- **Data Controller**: For the App, the data controller is **Replyer** (operated by the Replyer team).
- **Legal Bases**: We process your data based on:
  - **Performance of a contract** (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): to provide the core features of the App that you request.
  - **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR): to maintain and improve the App, prevent abuse, and operate analytics at a minimal and privacy‑respecting level.
  - **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR): where required, such as when you grant photo access or opt into specific analytics or personalization.

You have certain rights under GDPR and similar laws, including:

- The right to **access** your personal data.
- The right to **rectify** inaccurate data.
- The right to **delete** data in certain circumstances (for example, by deleting your style profile or contact profiles, or by uninstalling the App).
- The right to **object** to certain processing, or to request **restriction** of processing.
- The right to **data portability** where technically feasible.

Because most data used by the App is stored locally on your device (e.g., style profile, contact profiles), you can exercise many of these rights directly by:

- Deleting your style profile from the **My Style** screen.
- Editing or removing contact profiles in **Contact Profiles**.
- Revoking photo access in your device settings.
- Uninstalling the App (which removes locally stored data).

For data processed by third‑party services (Google Gemini API, RevenueCat), you may also exercise rights directly with those providers according to their own policies.

If you wish to exercise your rights or have questions, you can contact us using the email below. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
